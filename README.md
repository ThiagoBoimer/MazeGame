# MazeGame :joystick:
### A little game in pyhton

This was an activity in one of my python classes (_something like "make a simple game"_). Well, I did a Maze Game ðŸ˜„.

There's still not much to it, but I'm planning to add some features like levels, mouse icon, score/lives systems, sounds (maybe) and improving the way that the maze was drawn.
